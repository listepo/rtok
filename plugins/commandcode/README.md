# rtok Command Code plugin tree

The install source `rtok agents install commandcode` links from: rtok's hooks and its
MCP server as one unit (D21: plugin and MCP together, one `rtok mcp` per store).
Command Code documents no local plugin-bundle format (no `plugin.json` store like
Copilot's `installed-plugins/`), so this tree is the files the installer places, not
a bundle the host loads: `rtok-hook` is linked once per event, `mcp.sh` is the stdio
MCP command.

Install by hand:

- Link `hooks/rtok-hook` to one name per event Command Code fires (`PreToolUse`,
  `PostToolUse`, `SessionStart`, `Stop`) wherever the host reads its hook commands
  from, and put `{"command": "<link> …", "timeout": 5}` under the `hooks` key of
  `~/.commandcode/settings.json` (matchers: `SHELL|READ|WRITE|EDIT` on `PreToolUse`,
  `.*` on `PostToolUse`, none on lifecycle events).
- Register the MCP: `cmd mcp add rtok -- <path to scripts/mcp.sh>` (user scope).

`rtok` must be on `PATH` or under `~/.ketch/bin` (`ketch install listepo/rtok`);
every hook fails open when it is missing (exit 0, empty stdout except the one
SessionStart note) and the MCP script exits 1 with the ketch hint.

D21 singleton: use the plugin tree **or** `rtok agents install commandcode`, not both.
The installer writes the `hooks` key of `~/.commandcode/settings.json` and
`mcpServers.rtok` in `~/.commandcode/mcp.json` only while this tree is not linked;
with the tree linked it takes those two back instead of firing every event twice and
running two `rtok mcp` processes on one store.

Files:

- `hooks/rtok-hook` (executable) — takes its event from its own file name and runs
  `rtok hook <event> --host commandcode`; with `rtok` missing it prints `{}`, exits 0
  and names `ketch install listepo/rtok` on stderr.
- `scripts/mcp.sh` (executable) — `rtok mcp` with the same binary resolution.
